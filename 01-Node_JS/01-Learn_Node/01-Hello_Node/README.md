## Why Node.js?

Node.js excels at handling many simultaneous connections with minimal overhead, making it perfect for:

- Real-time applications (chats, gaming, collaboration tools)
- APIs and microservices
- Data streaming applications
- Command-line tools
- Server-side web applications

Its non-blocking, event-driven architecture makes it highly efficient for I/O-heavy workloads.

## What Can Node.js Do?

- Web Servers: Create fast, scalable network applications
- File Operations: Read, write, and manage files on the server
- Database Interaction: Work with databases like MongoDB, MySQL, and more
- APIs: Build RESTful services and GraphQL APIs
- Real-time: Handle WebSockets for live applications
- CLI Tools: Create command-line applications
